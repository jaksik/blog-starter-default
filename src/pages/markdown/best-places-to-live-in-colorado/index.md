There's a lot to considder when determining the best places to live in Colorado. Most people are attracted to the state by its cute mountain towns and opportunity for outdoor adventure, but are caught off gaurd by the high cost of living in Colororado.

It's possible to make it work in a mountain town, but for the majority of residents, the front range is home to the best places to live in Colorado due to cheaper housing and ample job opportunity.

## What are the best places to live in Colorado?
Perhaps your attacted to the high energy of a large city, or possibly a relaxed town full of winding bike paths is more your taste.

In a large and diverse state like Colorado, it's usually not difficult to discover a place that feels like home.

After considdering many different factors that make a place worth living in, such as cost of living, job opportunity, and quality of life, I've come up with this list to help others decide what's the best place for them to live in Colorado.

**These are the best places to live in Colorado:**

### 1. Colorado Springs

Relatively low housing costs, immediate access to the mountains, a healthy culture, and a thriving economy are what make Colorado Springs the best place to live in Colorado. This city has been rapidly growing over the years and for obvious reasons. Colorado Springs is the cheapest place to live in Colorado without sacrificing big city amenities and close proximity to nature. Being home to the olympic training center, the air force academy, and Pikes Peak make this city a destination worthy of any vacation. 

### 2. Fort Collins

A hamonious town that strikes the perfect balance between nature and development, Fort Collins is one of the most environmentally friendly towns in the world. Just 30 minutes south of the Wyoming border, this northen most city in Colorado is proud to be home to New Belgium Brewing and Colorado State University. Fort Collins has an easy going and accepting vibe that can be difficult to find else where. Home prices are reasonable here, but if they were a bit cheaper Fort Collins would be #1 on this list.

### 3. Boulder

Often considdered a crown jewel of Colorado, Boulder is a thriving little city that sits just below the iconic flatirons 45 minutes northwest of Denver. The citie's fantastic natural features, progressive culture, thriving tech scene, and top tier university has made this town of just over 100,000 a melting pot of world class athletes, hungry entrepreneurs, strung out hippies, and well known intelects. The fact that Boulder offers such a high quality of living has sent home prices astronomically soaring in recent years which makes it a less practical place to live ultimately bumping it down to the 3rd best place to live in Colorado.

### 4. Golden

A lesser known suburb of Denver metropolitan that often flies under the radar for people who are looking to move to the centenial state. Nestled between the mountains and large plateaus, Golden is a climber's mecca and by the time you are downtown it's easy to forget that Denver is just 20 minutes away. Full of history and activities, Golden has held on to its small town charm as surrounding areas have exploded in growth. It's these things plus its fantastic location to the mountains that keep home prices here at a steady high.

### 5. Denver

We hardly need an introduction for this one, Denver is the capitol and largest city of Colorado. This city has seen tremendous growth over the past decade as people are attracted to the amenities of a big city, but still crave access to the great outdoors. Denver is known for its thriving art sceen, progressive culture, and extensive list of up and coming breweries. The quick growth over the years have sent housing prices soaring and Denver is now the 2nd most expensive place to live on the front range just behind Boulder.

### 6. Lakewood

Arguably one of the best suburbs of Denver, Lakewood is the perfect place for those looking to strike a balance between the big city and the great outdoors. Located on the edge of the foot hills, half way between downtown Denver and the mountains, this thriving suburb offers a lot that many often look for in a vacation destination. Open space parks are scattered throughout the suburb, Red Rocks Amphitheatre is 15 minutes to the west, downtown Denver is 15 minutes to the east, and Loveland ski resort is just 35 minutes down I-70.

### 7. Grand Junction

Just an hour drive east of the Utah border, Grand Junction is the most western large town in Colorado. Being so far removed from other urban areas is likely what has allowed this small city to keep its relaxed vibe and small town charm as other places in the state have grown and changed over the years which is priceless and is why Grand Junction deserves a spot on this list. However, its more than a sleepy town on the wester slope, with a population of a small city and several progressive initiatives to diversify the economy in the upcoming years makes Grand Junction a practical place to live.

### Conclusion
Being one of the fastest growing states in the nation, the best places to live in Colorado have been consistently changing over the years. With housing prices soaring in some towns and traffic becoming a new norm, what once made a place great to live just may not be true anymore.
