So what actually makes a mountain town the best? The views? The adventurous activities? Or simply just the laid back vibes? 

Well, it's all of those things and more packed into these tiny communities that make them so great and make us day dream about them as we're sitting in the office.
 
## What are the best mountain towns in Colorado?
The best mountain towns in colorado are historic mining towns, world class ski resorts, and some of the highest towns in the entire United States. They are spread out across the mountainess western half of the state, almost touching the New Mexico border in the south and a stones throw away from the Wyoming border in the North.

In my years of chasing the deepest snow, summiting the highest peaks, and simply exploring the state I've had the opportunity to visit the vast majority of mountain towns in Colorado and I've made this list to share what I've found with others who appreciate what these charming towns have to offer.
 
**These are the best mountain towns in Colorado:**
### 1. Telluride

A world away from the populous front range, Telluride sits in the middle of the rugged San Juan mountain range at the far southwestern corner of the state. Being a long 6.5 hour drive from Denver has likely played a role in this town being able to hold on to its unique charm over the years as the rest of the state has grown in popularity.
 
### 2. Crested Butte

Also relatively far from the Front Range, Crested Butte is a gem of Colorado that has a welcoming hospitality. Having world class skiing, a cute downtown, and being surrounded by vast beautiful wilderness are what make this town so charming and puts it high on our list.
 
### 3. Steamboat Springs

Ski resorts and cute towns are easy to come by in Colorado, but to also boast numerous natural hot springs throughout the town is something unique to Steamboat Springs. After a long day of skiing on the mountain, there really is no better way to relax your soar muscles than to soak in one of the 10 hot springs that can be found around the town. Strawberry Springs and Old Town Springs are the most popular and are open all year round.
 
### 4. Grand Lake

An extemely popular destination for those making the infamous Trail Ridge Road drive, Grand Lake sits on the edge of Rocky Mountain National Park and is the perfect place to relax after a long day of exploring. Most commonly travellers will spend a few nights here after leaving Estes Park or vis versa.
 
### 5. Breckenridge

Boasting nearly 3,000 acres of skiable terrain and being just a 1.5 hour drive from Denver are likely why Breckenridge is one of the most popular destinations in Colorado. With over 1.5 million skiier visits each year, Breckenridge is a world class destination that welcomes people from around the globe. However, this amount of traffic makes Breckenridge extemely crowded during their busy seasons, which ultimately takes away from its charm and is why this town is #5 on the list.
 
### 6. Aspen

The glam, the arts, and the world class skiing are what make Aspen one the most well known mountain towns in the world. If it wasn't for the extremely high cost of living and slight vibe of exclusivity, Aspen would be higher on this list. With that said, Aspen truly is a melting pot of art, culture, and scenic beauty that compares to none and gives it that charm which makes it one of the best mountain towns in Colorado.
 
### 7. Ouray

Perhaps the most quiet and least visited town on the list, the historic mining town of Ouray is tucked away in the narrow canyons of the San Juan mountains and offers a feeling of remoteness that can be difficult to find else where. Known as the "Switzerland of America", Ouray is surround by soaring mountain peaks, narrow winding highways, and relaxing hot springs.
 
### 8. Estes Park

Known for being "the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park", Estes Park sits just outside one of the entrances to the national park and is often the base camp for people looking to explore. Also, just under 2 hours from Denver makes this a very popular day trip for those living on the front range. If you spend enough time here, you're likely to witness their famous elk herd which hangs around town and possibly even a bear or two that has wondered out of the mountains.
 
### 9. Leadville

At an elevation of 10,151 ft, Leadville is the highest incorporated town in the United States. Since its inception, Leadville's economy has been driven by mining which has allowed it to fly under the radar as its more popular neighbors, Vail and Breckenridge, have seen exponential growth over the decades. This has allowed Leadville to stay relatively sleepy and hold on to its small town charm.

Full of small town charm and natural beauty are what make the best mountain towns in Colorado some of the most special places in the United States.
